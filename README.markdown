  \- The Tale of the Curious Camera

This is a simple photo storing/browsing app that I plan on eventually using in Real Life.  I'm also
making it to have fun with Go, otherwise I would have used a framework.

#### Setup

Still not usable.

#### Run tests

From the project root: `go test ./app ./db`.  To get test output, you can pass `-v`, or run them one
package at a time with `go test` from the package directory.
